## What is Docker Image?

- An Image is a `read-only template` used to `create containers`. It contains the application code, libraries, and environment settings required for the application to run

- Images are `built using a Dockerfile`, which is a `simple text file` which defines the steps for creating the image

- Images can be `pulled from a registry (like Docker Hub)` or `created by users`
