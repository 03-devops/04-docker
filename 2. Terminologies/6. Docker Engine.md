- Listens for API requests and handles container lifecycle management (creating, running, stopping containers).

### Docker CLI

- The command-line tool that `interacts with the Docker Daemon` to run commands like docker build, docker run, docker ps, etc.

### Docker REST API

- A programmatic interface that allows communication with the Docker Daemon, enabling external applications or scripts to interact with Docker
