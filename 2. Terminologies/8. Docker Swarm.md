## What is Docker Swarm?

- Docker Swarm is `Dockerâ€™s native clustering and orchestration tool`. It allows you to `manage a cluster of Docker nodes` (machines) and `deploy services` across them.

- Docker Swarm offers `basic container orchestration` with low overhead. However, `Kubernetes is a more robust solution`, especially when you need high availability, scaling, and fault tolerance in large-scale apps
