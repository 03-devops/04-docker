## What is Container?

- A container is `an isolated environment` that includes `everything an application needs to run`, such as the code, libraries, dependencies, and system tools

- Containers are `lightweight` and `share the host system's OS kernel`, which makes them more efficient than traditional virtual machines (VMs).
